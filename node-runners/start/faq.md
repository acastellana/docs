## Node Client FAQ

### Can I have several nodes/clients behind the same IP address?

Yes. You may have multiple nodes behind a single IP address, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you increase the chance of earning more rewards.

### Do I require a static IP address to run a node?

Yes, you need a static IP address to run a node. In most cases, you'll have to configure your router's port forwarding rules. A static IP address gives a fixed address to your computer on the local network at your business. Port forwarding is used by computers on the Internet to connect to a specific device on your internal network. To set up port forwarding, you must assign specific ports or a range of ports to a particular IP address.

### How do I get one?

You get a static IP address from your ISP \(internet service provider\), or the easier option is to run the node on a VPS \(virtual private server\) with a static IP.

### What are the minimum hardware requirements to run a node?

The current requirements are:

* 2 CPU cores 
* 8 GB memory 
* 256 GB disk

### Is there a guide to set up a node?

The guide to help you get started with the node-client software is [published here](./). We will notify you when the public node client is released if you've signed up to our mailing list.  Rest assured, nodes will be easy to set up.

### Do you need Radix tokens to host a node?

No, Radix doesn't require any tokens to host a node.

### Is there a main net or test network to test or run a node?

Thereâ€™s a private Test network on [https://explorer.radixdlt.com/](https://explorer.radixdlt.com/), but no public testnet yet. There will be open developer betas in the near future though, so we suggest signing up for the mailing list.
