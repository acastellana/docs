## FAQ

This document is a compilation of questions that have been asked by the Radix community members across different channels.

### Is Radix token a stable coin?

No, not quite. Radix has several token types that are possible to create on the Radix platform. One of these tokens is the Radix low volatility coin, which aims to create a token with a more predictable, less volatile value to make it more useful as a currency. This Radix token will have an elastic supply.   
  
It is not pegged to fiat currencies, assets or a basket of goods. It is a relatively stable coin which derives its value from the utility of the network. It is elastic in supply and price stabilized at the protocol level, governed by an economic monetary supply policy. More information will be shared in the upcoming economics white paper.

### When is the economics white paper going to be published?

Economic incentive design of the Radix Public Network and the stable coin mechanism are highly critical to its success. We are simulating, iterating and experimenting with different economic theories before launching. The economics white paper will only be published after rigorous review and confidence in the  theories we put forward.

### Where do Radix tokens come from?

The initial Radix token supply is going to be distributed to the early-backers of the Radix platform. Subsequently, new tokens are created by the decentralized exchange if and when the demand for the token increases. Part of the newly created tokens are then distributed to the existing token holders and node runner as a reward. % reward is not decided yet.

### Who will generate or burn the Radix Low Volatility Token?

Using a decentralized exchange \(DEX\) people will be able to trade Radix tokens for their respective cryptocurrency and fiat pairs. If none of the Radix token holders are selling, to keep the price of the token relatively stable, the DEX will create new tokens that would partially fulfill the buy order.

The Radix monetary supply policy will dictate creation or destruction of the Radix native tokens. Full details of the Radix Low Volatility Token will be released in the upcoming Economics White Paper.

### What determines the price of the Radix token?

There are several different token types that can be issued on the Radix network.

One of the most hotly anticipated is the Radix low volatility coin, which, when launched will have a starting value which is to be decided. The coin value will be 'relatively' stable, not pegged \(ie. it is NOT fixed at $x forever. 

Over the longer term, the price will increase in a controlled manner if there is a sustained imbalance between the supply side and the demand side. The higher the sustained imbalance to the demand side, the higher the price and the more tokens will be in circulation. The price discovery process will allow it to float up/down, but the economics will attempt to smooth out the peaks and troughs to reduce volatility.

This is still an experimental coin type and the full details will be released in the upcoming Economics White Paper.

### **With which currencies can we purchase XRD with?**

You will be able purchase the Radix XRD token with fiat currencies like the dollar via off/on ramps. More information will be released in the economics white paper.

### **Will Radix have KYC?**

The Radix decentralized exchange will not have KYC. But fiat on/off ramps should follow standard KYC and ****AML checks.

### What is the incentive to setup/run a full-node?

Simply, the more services - which includes number of shards - that a node provides for the Radix network, the larger the potential earning base. Each node earns fees from any Temporal Proof's they create. The distribution of which nodes provide the temporal proofs is probabilistic, not resource intensive. In other words, you don't have to ‘mine a block’ to get TX fees, just confirm a transaction!

A machine will automatically maintain as many shards as are possible, given its resources; very small machines will run only a few shards, large machines many more.
