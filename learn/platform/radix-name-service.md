# Radix Name Service

RNS is the Radix Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Radix protocol.

Its job is to map human-readable names like ‘dan.radix’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Radix addresses, content hashes, and metadata. 

RNS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture, due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Radix Tempo Ledger. 

The Radix Name service will provide flexible resolution of short, human-readable names to service and resource identifiers. This service helps users and developers to refer to human-readable and easy to remember names and permits those names to be updated as necessary when the underlying resource \(contract, content-addressed data, etc\) changes.

More information will be released as we progress through our Roadmap.
